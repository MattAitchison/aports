Hello.

You might be interested to know, that I managed to build a
musl + LLVM (clang, libc++) based, self hosted system.

The hardest part was to scrub libgcc and libstdc++ dependencies.
Using instructions from Wiki[1] and hints from this list[2] and LLVM
bugtracker[3] I finally managed to get a self-hosting system able to
rebuild itself clean without any GCC help.

It requires a bit arm-twisting to LLVM compiler and libs, but it looks
like it works just fine. The musl/libc++/clang++ env is able to build
working libc++ and clang++, which I consider GoodEnough(TM) test case.

If you want to toy around with it you can install it directly from repo.

# mkdir /mnt/test	# I usually mount a btrfs subvolume here
# apk.static --repository http://ftp.d-os.eu/latest/core --update-cache --allow-untrusted --root /mnt/test --initdb add dos-base dos-sdk libcxx-dev

It is based on great work of Alpine Linux.
Still heavily work-in-progress and very rough on edges, but I think it
may be very useful for people trying to get free of GNU libc, libstdc++
and GCC bits, so I decided to share early.
Also it is good to have some more eyes on as there is a lot of guesswork
there.

The apk sources with required patches and some quick notes are on
GitHub: https://github.com/D-os/aports/tree/master/core
